# FocusTown
A web application for focus and productivity, built with React, JavaScript, and CSS. 

## Motivation
I wanted to build an app for organizing and focusing on my daily tasks, and for gaining insights into my productivity. This app aims to be as easy and intuitive to use as possible, so that you don't need to invest time and effort learning how to use it.
